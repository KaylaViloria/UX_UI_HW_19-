                        The original site did not look like a trustworthy site to be taking volunteers or donations. It wasn’t inviting whatsoever. We wanted to show that this was a site that could actually bring hope to children.
                        We cut a lot of unnecessary text as to not overwhelm the user.
                        Unfortunately, the originally owners of the website did not want anything to do with our redesign because we really brought this website to life and made it very playful for both kids and parents.

                        The USDA original website was extremely boring and had an overload of information thrown in your face at once. I wanted to redesign this website to be more inviting and less stressful on the eyes.
                        There was a lot of testing involved to make sure we could get the right kind of navigation for everyone to understand. I wanted to make it as clean and simple as possible.
                        In the end, the navigation was a lot more clear and there wasn’t as much text being thrown out to drive people away.

                        This was a project that a partner and I came up with that would be beneficial to all people of all ages. We wanted to find an easier way to save memories, journal events, and reminisce on past moments. There is lots of social media out there that can help you see old things that are posted but we don’t always talk about how we really feel or how we really are for all to see.
